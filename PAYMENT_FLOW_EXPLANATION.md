## 💳 Payment Flow Process

### **Step-by-Step User Journey:**

1. **User selects plan** (Monthly/Quarterly/Annual/9-Month)
2. **User selects payment method** (Card/PayPal/PayPay/Konbini)
3. **User clicks "Subscribe"**
4. **Frontend calls** `create-checkout-session` Edge Function
5. **Edge Function:**
   - Creates/retrieves Stripe customer
   - Checks payment method availability
   - Creates Stripe Checkout Session
   - Returns checkout URL
6. **User redirected to Stripe Checkout**
7. **User enters payment details** (if card) or authorizes (PayPal/PayPay)
8. **Stripe processes payment** (or starts trial)
9. **User redirected to** `/payment/success`
10. **Stripe webhook fires** → Updates subscription in database
11. **User becomes Premium** → `isPremium = true`
