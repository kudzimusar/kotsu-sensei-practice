## 📍 Navigation Logic

### Profile Page Button Logic:
```typescript
onClick={() => navigate(isPremium ? "/account" : "/payment")}
```

- **Free users** → "Upgrade" button → `/payment`
- **Premium users** → "Manage" button → `/account`

### Settings Dialog:
- Shows subscription status summary
- "Manage" button → `/account` (for premium users)
- "Upgrade" button → `/payment` (for free users)

---

## 🔄 State Transitions

### Free User → Premium:
1. User on free plan
2. Clicks "Upgrade" → `/payment`
3. Completes checkout
4. Webhook updates subscription
5. `isPremium` becomes `true`
6. Button changes from "Upgrade" to "Manage"
7. Navigation changes from `/payment` to `/account`

### Premium User → Free (Cancellation):
1. User on premium plan
2. Clicks "Manage" → `/account`
3. Clicks "Manage Subscription" → Stripe Portal
4. Cancels subscription
5. Webhook updates subscription status
6. Subscription continues until period end
7. After period end, `isPremium` becomes `false`
8. Button changes back to "Upgrade"

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always check subscription status** before showing upgrade/manage options
2. **Use `usePremium()` hook** to get current subscription state
3. **Show appropriate messaging** based on user's current plan
4. **Handle edge cases:**
   - User with canceled subscription (still premium until period end)
   - User with past_due subscription
   - User with trial subscription
